This configuration:
- Makes all Playwright tests run in headed mode (visible browser) by default
- Can be overridden via command line with `--headless`
- Controls global pytest behavior without requiring code changes

### conftest.py
`conftest.py` is a special pytest file that provides fixtures and configuration that can be shared across multiple test files.

Key features:
- Contains shared fixtures (like browser setup, page objects)
- Automatically discovered by pytest
- Available to all test files without explicit imports
- Perfect for:
  - Browser initialization
  - Common test data
  - Shared helper functions
  - Setup and teardown procedures

### config.py
`config.py` is a custom configuration file that stores project-specific settings and environment variables.

Typically includes:
- Environment URLs (dev, staging, prod)
- API endpoints
- Test data paths
- Browser configurations
- Database connection strings
- Credentials (though these should be handled securely)
